Orb Aerospace


Welcome to the official GitHub repository of Orb Aerospace, a Michigan-based aerospace company specializing in the design, manufacture, and flight operations of hybrid electric transition aircraft that can operate without depending on existing infrastructure. 


🌍 Mission

We believe the future of aviation must be accessible, resilient, and redemptive. Orb builds aircraft to connect people and goods in places where traditional aviation cannot, whether that’s remote communities, disaster zones, or contested environments.


Our mission is clear: accessible aviation for all mankind. 


✈️ What We Build

Orb is developing hybrid-electric VTOL aircraft that combine the flexibility of helicopters with the efficiency of fixed-wing flight. Our platforms are engineered for real-world utility and durability, featuring:

•	Redundant propulsion and flight-critical systems

•	Modular wings and payload bays for mission-specific roles

•	Vertical + horizontal flight for maximum adaptability


From humanitarian relief to frontier logistics, our designs are built to endure where others cannot.




🧠 Philosophy

We’re not here to hype the future, we’re here to build it, together. Orb Aerospace is guided by three convictions:


•	Aviation should be within reach for all, not just for the elite.

•	Technology should be practical and purposeful, not performative.

•	Community is the greatest multiplier—we build with and for people.
